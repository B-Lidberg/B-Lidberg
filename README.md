## Hey, You!
*Here's a bit about me*

I have been self-studying my way as a developer since coming back to to the United States in December after nearly 2 years abroad with some time spent in *Thailand* & the rest in *New Zealand*! :earth_asia:

After completing MOOC **Java** courses, I stepped into learning **Kotlin** as my passion towards becoming an **Android Developer** grew. Being involved in the Android Community in places such as Twitter, Reddit, & numerous Kotlin Slack Channels has been an exciting experience. I love contributing to the community in ways that I can, such as creating open-source project(s) or helping answer questions where possible 

My favorite types of projects to work on involve apps used for Productivity or Educational purposes! :smile:

##### I am actively seeking an opportunity to fill my first Android Developer role. Being an ideal candidate if you're interested in or are currently developing using Jetpack Compose or towards *KMP/KMM*.
-  I am open to learning new technologies
-  Willing to relocate / work remote

---

### What I'm focusing on
 I picked up and am currently improving my skills with  **KMM Potential technologies*** such as :
 - **Jetpack Compose** being my primary tool for developing Android on the Front-End 
 - **Ktor** as the server of choice for back-end


 *[Daily Doc](https://github.com/B-Lidberg/DailyDoc)* has been a personal project that I take pride in as I continue to add functionality and soon implement a professional-looking UI Design. It features many NEW tools that I hope others will be able to use as an example as they learn and build apps utilizing these same libraries.
